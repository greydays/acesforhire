#Notes

- show/hide data toggles will need unique ids inserted so that they don't conflict with each other

- The logo gif has been inserted into the create-account.html header, but the font isn't right. The logo and company name may need to be a single image. Or perhaps you can just use the logo gif after the initial splash page.

- The navbar is too long on ipad portrait view: limit nav links? Shorten link names? Drop down menu? Change query to menu button at larger view?

- the calendar glyph on the date search is displaying weird on ios. Is fine on browers and android.
