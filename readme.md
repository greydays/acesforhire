#Notes

- show/hide data toggles will need unique ids inserted so that they don't conflict with each other

- I inserted the gif into the create-account.html header, but the font isn't right. The logo and company name may need to be an image. Or perhaps you can just use the ace of spades image after the initial splash page.
